## Hi, I'm Serag Ehab 👋

AI Engineer with a background in Mechatronics Engineering, specializing in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I focus on building well-founded, production-oriented AI systems while maintaining a strong understanding of the underlying theory.

I’m currently working on advanced AI and computer vision projects through the NTI Hire-Ready Scholarship, covering the full ML pipeline from data preparation and model design to evaluation and deployment. My work includes deep learning architectures, generative models, object detection, and multi-agent AI systems using LLMs.

Alongside AI, I have hands-on experience in autonomous systems and robotics as a former F1TENTH member with ASU Racing, where I worked on perception, localization, and control for autonomous navigation, integrating vision-based perception with real-world robotic systems.

**Tools & Technologies:**  
Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, OpenCV, FastAPI, Streamlit, LangChain, LangGraph, Git
